    "# Image GANs for Generating Dogs \n",
    "We've been learning about AI-generated images in our module on Vision, Images, and Art. Many computer-generated images, like deep fake videos, leverage something called Generative Adversarial Netowrks (GANs). In this homework, we explore using existing GANs libraries for image generation!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will be using a generative adversarial network trained on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), which we've discussed in lecture previously. Although there are many non-dog classes in ImageNet, we will be focusing our experiments on dog photos. A high quality GAN is tricky to design well and takes dozens of hours or days to train, so to save ourselves computation time, we are using a pre-trained GAN with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",
